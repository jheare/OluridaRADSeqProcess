# Background on Oly RAD-Seq #

The *Ostrea lurida* population structure and local adaptation project has been ongoing for two years now. This project is looking at three geographically separated populations in Puget Sound Washington using a reciprocal transplant experiment to monitor differences in phenotypes between each population. The first year of the phenotype project has been completed, so no we are moving on to the second half of the project. Evaluating the genetic differences between the populations to determine underlying genotype differences. We are using restriction enzyme-digested DNA sequencing to produce genomic information for every sampled individual from the sampled populations. By comparing this information using the program STACKS and STRUCTURE or GenePop we will able to create a catalog of single nucleotide polymorphisms for each individual and compare them to a population average catalog to identify unique properties of each population in each environment. To do this second part we selected samples from the original outplant populations for RAD-Sequencing.

#Processing of Restriction-enzyme Assisted DNA Sequence Data for *O. lurida* #
---

The goal of this project is to take raw RAD Sequencing information from *Ostrea lurida* samples and run it through Stacks so it can be analyzed for information about *O. lurida* population structure with Puget Sound Washington. 

The raw sequence files are not available at the moment due to size constraints. But you can look through the [workflow](https://github.com/jheare/Fish546-Jake/tree/master/Course%20Project/Workflow) to understand how the process works. You can also read through the documents provided in the [Product](https://github.com/jheare/Fish546-Jake/tree/master/Course%20Project/Product) directory to learn about the background of the project, the methods, and the data record.
